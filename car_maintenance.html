      <h3>What is a VIN or vehicle identification number?</h3>
      <br />
      <p class="info">
        The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is a distinctive 17-character
        code assigned by manufacturers to each automobile, functioning as an
        automotive equivalent to a social security number. It provides
        comprehensive information about the vehicle, including details like
        year, make, model, engine size, manufacturer, manufacturing location,
        and safety features. Beyond specifying vehicle specifications, a VIN can
        be employed to identify recalls, registrations, warranty claims,
        insurance coverage, and theft records.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>Why is checking a VIN on a used car important?</h3>
      <br />
      <p class="info">
        When contemplating the purchase of a pre-owned vehicle, it's crucial to
        inspect the car's VIN. This examination aids in assessing the quality
        and reliability of the used car. Inconsistencies between the advertised
        VIN and the vehicle's make and model may signal a potential scam or
        unauthorized modifications. Employing a standard third-party VIN check
        can further unveil essential vehicle history details, such as reports of
        theft or a clean title.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>How to find your car's VIN number?</h3>
      <br />
      <p class="info">
        Search for your car's VIN on the front of the dashboard, situated on the
        driver's side. The VIN is most visible from outside the vehicle, viewed
        through the windshield, in the space where the hood meets the
        windshield. Alternatively, locate the VIN on the driver's side door
        post. This area is visible when you open the door and inspect the region
        near where the door latches to the car. If the VIN is not readily found
        on the car, it should be printed on your insurance cards and your
        vehicle's title.
